			<div class="itright">Hi! My name is <strong>David A. Turner</strong>. Welcome to my
			website!</div>

		<p>I am Java Developer of 15+ years experience hailing from
			Pittsburgh, PA. I am currently studying additional technical skills
			so that I can become a full fledged full stack software engineer.
			When I am not working I enjoy playing Chess, reading up on current
			events, and writing music for a couple of local bands.</p>

			<h1>My Background</h1>
			<div class="itright">A graduate of Carnegie Mellon University,
				BS in Electrical Engineering</div>
		</header>
		<p>My degree in engineering landed a job working on annunciator
			systems of 1000kw nuclear plants. From there I was introduced to
			programming programming device drivers in c. When I made the career
			jump to Healthcare I ran a Claims Clearinghouse for a local private
			insurer before it was sold to a national company. I eventually went
			back the private insurer to learn enterprise server side programming
			using Java, structs, jsp and Oracle relational database. In my last
			employment I focused on developing front-end and web development
			applications.</p>

			<h1>Why I Decided to Continue Learning Programming</h1>
			<div class="itright">A Necessary Step!</div>
		</header>
		<p>Software engineering has evolved since I start working in
			software over 15 years ago. Enterprise applications are no longer
			exclusive to mid-size IBM-like corporations. The Open Source
			community has been busy developing servers and software frameworks
			that tests the old notions of adequacy in one knowing a single
			language and database running on an enterprise server. Nowadays even
			one with my experience would find it difficult to compete with
			younger engineers who know dozens of languages and who can create
			software covering the full spectrum of modern apps: server side,
			front end, web development, REST API, as well as device and IoT
			programming. I can no longer consider continuing my education a
			Bucket List choice. I must chose a Path that increases my technical
			skills else consider my career in programming all but over.</p>
