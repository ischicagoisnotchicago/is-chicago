      <p>I am Java Developer of 15+ years experience hailing from Pittsburgh, PA.  I am currently studying additional technical skills so that I can become
        a full fledged full stack software engineer. When I am not working I enjoy playing Chess, reading up on current events, 
        and writing music for a couple of local bands.</p>

        <h1 class="center">My Background</h1><br>
        <em>A graduate of Carnegie Mellon University, BS in Electrical Engineering</em><br>
      </header>
      <p>My degree in engineering landed a job working on annunciator systems of 1000kw nuclear plants. From
        there I was introduced to programming programming device drivers in c. When I made the career jump to Healthcare
        I ran a Claims Clearinghouse for a local private insurer before it was sold to a national company. I eventually
        went back the private insurer to learn enterprise server side programming using Java, structs, jsp and Oracle
        relational database. In my last employment I focused on developing front-end and web development applications.</p>

        <h1 class="center">Why I Decided to Continue Learning Programming</h1><br>
        <em>A Necessary Step!</em><br>
      </header>
      <p>Software engineering has evolved since I start working in software over 15 years ago. Enterprise applications
        are no longer exclusive to mid-size IBM-like corporations. The Open Source community has been busy developing servers
        and software frameworks that tests the old notions of adequacy in one knowing a single language and database running on 
        an enterprise server. Nowadays even one with my experience would find it difficult to compete with younger engineers who 
        know dozens of languages and who can create software covering the full spectrum of modern apps: server side, front end,
        web development, REST API, as well as device and IoT programming. I can no longer consider continuing my education
        a Bucket List choice. I must chose a Path that increases my technical skills else consider my career in programming
        all but over.</p>
